# Stop! ✋ ♥️ ♠️ ♦️ ♣
A quick and easy to understand card game that's a lot of fun. All you need is a standard deck of playing cards.

Number of players: `2-N`

Playing time: `5-10 minutes`

## Goal
The goal of the game is to be the player with the less amount of points. When you think you have the less amount of points, you should say **"Stop!"** - then all players reveal their cards and the player with the less amount of points wins the game. The tricky part is that your cards must be face down during the entire game.


## How to Play
Start by shuffling the deck and distribute **3** cards face down for each player. During game, players should keep their cards face down _all the time_.

In turns, each player should pick a card from the main deck, look at it, and decide if they want to keep that card or discard them onto the discard pile. If the player decides to keep the card they have just pulled from the deck, they should keep the card face down and choose one of their previous cards (without looking!) and discard it instead. 

When you decide to keep a card you pulled from the deck, you'll know one of your cards (the one you have just picked from the deck) and you should try to remember what that card is to know when to say **"Stop!"** and end the match.

## Scoring
The Ace is worth `1` point. The court cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth `11`, `12` and `13` points respectively, with exception of the Red Kings (see _Special Effects_ below), as each Red King is worth zero points, making them the best cards in the game.

## Special Effects
Each court card has a special effect that is activated when discarded:

🔴👑 **Red King**: is worth 0 points - the best card in the game!

⚫️👑 **Black King**: is worth 13 points - the _worst_ card in the game!

🔴🫅🏻 **Red Queen**: you can look one of your cards

⚫️🫅🏻 **Black Queen**: you can look one card of another other player 

🔴🤴🏽 **Red Jack**: you can switch one of your cards with another player

⚫️🤴🏽 **Black Jack**: you can switch 2 cards from other players

When a player discards a court card, the player might choose to use the card's special effect or not. 
Alternatively, you can also play saying that using the court card's special effect is mandatory.

## Stack-discarding
You can also end the game with less cards than the other players by stack-discarding: when another player discards one card, if you already know you have a card of the same value, you can then discard your card on top of the other player's card.

For example: if one player discards a `7`, and you already know you have a `7` with you, then you can discard it on top of the other player's `7` even when it's not your turn, this way you'll have less cards in your hand!

**Be careful though:** if you _think_ you have the same card, and when you reveal it on the discard pile, it turns out it's a different value, you should take it back into your hand _and_ get another card from the main deck, making you have `4` cards!

This rule can also be applied to court cards.

Have fun! ✨
